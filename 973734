I am not into web development, just sharing some info.

Firstly, will my design skills translate in anyway within a role like this?
I do believe so.

Secondly, where would people recommend I begin as far as formal training.
I have heard of many options. There are coding bootcamps, workshops, nanodegree programs, university-level courses from eDx, etc. Some of my friends also enrolled in the Treehouse techdegree.

I wish you the best.
