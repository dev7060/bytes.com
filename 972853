- Scope resolution operator is not required before parameterized constructor of class Time.

- Why is there a parameterized constructor for the Time class if it's not even being used?

- Provided text says, start & end: The starting and ending times of the event. Both represent the time in the format hh:mm:ss.

- It is quiet clear that any primitive data type can't hold a value in such format. However, it can kinda be stored in a character array but it'll then create issues in further calculations as the data type is not suitable for storing such values.

-User defined data type structure can be used in such case. The structures can be declared inside Time class like:

 struct s {
     int hh;
     int mm;
     int s;
 };
 struct e {
     int hh;
     int mm;
     int ss;
 };
 struct s start;
 struct e end;
 
 
 -All the values can be initialized in constructor as:
 
 ...
 start.hh=h1;
 start.mm=m1;
 start.ss=s1;
 end.hh=h2;
 end.mm=m2;
 end.ss=s2;
...
 
 
 where h1, m1, h2 etc. are formal arguments of constructor.

- These values can be initialized in default constructor as

start.hh=start.mm=start.ss=end.hh=end.mm=end.ss=0;
