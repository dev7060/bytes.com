I am not sure if anything like that exists. This whole sounds like client requirements to get something custom built. For such app to function, every site you want the info from, needs to have its API to deliver the content from its database. It's not directly possible to fetch the results from the web. Authentication is required with your application to get the database content through API. Once you have the data (which is provided in JSON, HTML and other formats), it can be used accordingly on your side. Also, the data obtained must be used according to the site terms and policies.
