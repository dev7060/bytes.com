Here are the few things I noticed:

1: On line 37, change 'char &month' to 'int &month'.
2: On line 60 and 88, the functions are trying to return more than one values. A function can return only one value.
[ left operand of comma operator has no effect [-Wunused-value] ]
3: As mentioned by @weaknessforcats, initialise the variables.

Also, try to mention some theoretical concept of the program as by that it would be easy for others to analyse the program well.
