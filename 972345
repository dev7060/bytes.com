Well, to be honest I have never experienced anything like that with any of my flash drive. I have used Sony and San Disk but never found anything extra other than the files I put there.
Also, I have seen this video https://youtu.be/26fN2ANjQNs?t=315 , where there is a file present already. I guess, it may happen when you buy stuff from different sources other than the official one.
I would suggest to format the drive and scan it with an antivirus before proceeding to do anything. Also, you can always refer to their customer support for any query. They can explain you the things much better.
