Abstract classes cannot be instantiated because abstract methods have no body, so they will make the program to stop at run-time if an object calls any of such methods.

Constructors are allowed because of the concept of inheritance. Abstract classes can be inherited. And to initialize the child class' objects, constructor is to be called. But before calling its own constructor (child class constructor), parent class constructor is called first (refer to the rules of inheritance).
