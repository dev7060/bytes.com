You have put a semicolon just before the definition of function body which literally means the function has no body.

That is required only in the declaration of function as it tells the compiler the function name, return type and the no. and types of arguments.

# Preprocessor directives
 
//Function declaration
return-type name(number and types of arguments);
 
main(){
 body of main
}
 
//function definition
return-type name (arguments details){
function body
}

However if the function is defined before the main function, there is no need of declaration.
