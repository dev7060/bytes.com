"(struct sockaddr*)&serveraddr"

Explicit type casting is done here. serveraddr is an object of structure sockaddr_in, but my guess is that the second actual parameter of connect() requires an address of type sockaddr and holds the address in a sockaddr type pointer (via formal arguments).

This is similar to what is done with primitive data types like int, float etc. And structure is also a data type (derived one). For example, while dynamically allocating memory,

int *ptr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * length);

malloc() returns a void* type value, that's why explicit type conversion is done to convert it to int* type and then assign it to an int type pointer. However, in this particular case it is unnecessary since void* is automatically promoted to any other pointer type.
