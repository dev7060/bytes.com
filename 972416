Mind showing more of your code?


------------------------------------


I tried to run the code in CodeBlocks. It showed me tons of errors. Also, I couldn't find the one you asked for. Looks like you are implementing FCFS CPU scheduling algo. Maybe try to post the code after removing the basic syntax errors of curly braces and stuff.
