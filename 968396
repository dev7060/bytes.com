Maybe you are asking how to convert this statement into code form. For this, the formula 'π r²' can be written as area= 3.14*r*r.

Complete program for this:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
 
    float r, area;
    cout<<"Enter radius of circle: ";
    cin>>r;
    area= 3.14*r*r;
    cout<<"Area of circle is:"<<area;
    return 0;
}
