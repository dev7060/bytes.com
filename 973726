I have had not so good experience with their product. Had to contact the support every time to deactivate the license of the previous installation in case i decide to reset windows or want to use the license in a new installation. There was no option available to do such in the account settings. Plus, it was weird that the antivirus used to get uninstalled on its own multiple times. Not sure if that was because of a bug or what.
