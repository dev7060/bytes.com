Single quote refers to a single character. Double quote makes it a string literal. The size of a string is: number of characters*size of each char plus 1 (of the terminator). Terminator is present at the end of a string. It is '\0' , called NUL in ASCII.
Let's consider char X takes 1 byte. Therefore:
'X' = 1 byte
"X" = 2 bytes

You can check these values as well, like:

    char y = 'X';
    cout<<sizeof(y);
 ---------------------------------------
    char y[]= "X";
    cout<<sizeof(y);
