Well there may be many things to look upon. Maybe you are using a syntax which is not supported as standard by the IDE. Maybe some files in the CodeBlocks installation directory is missing (or accidently deleted). In that case, reinstallation is required. Try to post your code or maybe post the errors you are getting.
