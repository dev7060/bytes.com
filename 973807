You gotta think the way the machine is processing stuff.

Binary of 4 = 100 , 1's complement representation: 011, 2's complement representation: 100

But, sizeof(int) = 4 bytes = 32 bits which means the machine is processing numbers with respect to 32 bits.

Therefore, -4 is represented as 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100

which is equivalent to (2^32-1)-3

Hence, variable1+variable2 means ((2^32-1)-3)+1 which results in 4294967293 and is not a garbage value.
