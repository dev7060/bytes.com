Hi there. I think that every sector uses the technology of software, web, mobile, etc. to get things done in a fast and efficient way. And the modern world work using all of these. There are many examples like for healthcare: appointment scheduling software, prescription software, software to analyze data, custom made software according to requirements, etc. The equipment used in the medical industry like MRI, X-Ray machines are programmed in computer languages. Huge amount of data is stored in servers and is synchronized timely. Plus there are many other things to be taken care of that require a software/web developer. Even for social services, by using the internet, websites, social media, etc., the services can be provided in a better way. So to conclude, I do believe there is definitely scope. I wish you the best.
