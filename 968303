Yes, the above pattern can be printed using output statements. However, you may also use loops for this. Try to mention your approach/code you are using.

Some idea: In the 2nd line, you can observer that 0s are present at even places [*2*4*] and in the 3rd line at odd places [1*3*5] etc. So, declare an array of length 5 and use the modulus operator to check for even and odd places and assign the value of 0 to them, the rest of the array can contain *.
