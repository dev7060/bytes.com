Sounds too generic theory to me.
You want to automate some specific jobs and in order to so that you need to use web scraping techniques. (Say you can only use Python for the web. scr.)
How would you do it?
By programming the part that would automate the stuff.
How would you execute those Python scripts? Through PHP or at specific times from system commands?
How would you save your results?

Would you use the database or pass them (somehow) straight to a PHP script?
Depends on the data you're dealing with.
How would you "map" and maintain this whole new system of automation?
What kind of maintenance are we talking about here?
