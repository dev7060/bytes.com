Seems like an assignment question to me. If you read here[https://bytes.com/faq.php?faq=posting_guidelines#faq_how_to_ask_a_question] , it clearly says the site is not for such type of questions.

I have used ArgoUML[http://argouml.tigris.org/] for designing models. You can show us your work or anything you have done so far. We would be happy to assist you with that.
