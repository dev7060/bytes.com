I stumbled upon a few codes in the past that made me research this topic. Codes such as:
(C)
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
float x=0.7;
printf("%.10f %.10f\n",0.7, x);
 
Output: 0.7000000000 0.6999999881


(C++)
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
float x=1.7;
if(x==1.7)
 cout<<"Equal";
else
 cout<<"Unequal";
 
Output: Unequal

, etc...

Interesting enough for me to dig into the rabbit hole to understand the behavior of floating points.

Here's a read if anyone's interested:
