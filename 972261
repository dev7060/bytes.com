You declared "membername" as int type but I am pretty sure you must be providing a string type value. Declare "memebername" as a string array and it'll be fine.
--------------------------------------------------

You need to look at data types and their correct usage.

Here, "membername" needs to be a string, so we declared it as string data type. But both "oweight" and "lostw" will contain numeric values, so they need to be declared as int/float/double according to the need.

Since you declared "oweight" and "lostw" as strings, you are treating them as strings and hence, using getline() function to store string type values in them.
Later on you are using operators that are not meant to be used with string type values. The error you got is all about this.

Here's what you have to change:
- Declare oweight and lostw as int/float type.
- Replace the getline() function with the simple console input keyword (cin) for them.
It should be working now.
