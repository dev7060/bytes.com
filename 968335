Well, I coded this as simple as possible. But I agree with @Frinavale.
Post your problem/ code after trying, as directly asking will not help you learning and building logics in programming.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char name[10]; //For name of the employee
int hours; //No. of hours an employee worked last week
float rate; //Hourly rate of an employee
float gross_pay;
float extra; // Extra amount added to pay
int num; // For number of employees
//Declared variables in separate lines just for explaining purpose
cout<<"Enter the number of employees: ";
cin>>num;
//Loop to input employee data and calculating gross salary
for(int i=1; i<=num; i++)
{
cout<<"\n Enter the details of employee: "<<i;
cout<<"\n Enter name";
cin>>name;
cout<<"\n Enter the number of hours worked last week: ";
cin>>hours;
cout<<"\n Enter the hourly rate: ";
cin>>rate;
extra=0;
if( hours>40)
{
 extra=((hours-40) * (rate + (0.5*rate)));
}
 
gross_pay=(hours*rate)+extra;
 
cout<<"\n Gross pay of the employee is: "<<gross_pay<<"\n";
}
 
return 0;
}
