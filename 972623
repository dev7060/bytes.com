What do you mean by x0 and x1?

If they are variables, you can use array to store values in a continuous manner.

for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
  scanf("%d", &x[i]);
 
 Here: x0, x1, x2 etc. will hold same types of values.
-------------------------------

If you mean that as a multiplication sign,

while(condition){
   value = value x i;
   i=i+1;
}
 
 
Initialise the values of 'i' and 'values' accordingly.
