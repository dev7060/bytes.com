char arr[] : It's a character array, which is different from a String in many manners. Like:
- String methods cannot be used
-'+' overloaded operator can't be used
- It is stored in heap memory whereas String literals are stored in the String constant pool.
-A string can't be iterated over characters using loop, etc.

char arr[] = new char[6]
I am not sure about this declaration. 'new' is used to dynamically allocate memory. So the right hand side of the expression is allocating memory and returning an address.
When we declare an array, its name points to the first element. Here I guess the returned address is stored in arr.

On a side note, new is used with jagged arrays like:

char[][] arr = new char[2][];
arr[0] = "Hello".ToCharArray();
arr[1] = "cat".ToCharArray();
 
 
But it's a 2D system with variable number of columns in each row.
