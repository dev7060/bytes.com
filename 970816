- random(value) generates a random number from 0 to 'value-1'.

Possible outcomes:

-When, count =3,
Trick can be 0, 1 or 2
Turn+Trick can be (i.e. 5+trick) 5, 6 or 7
Status[Trick] can be Status[0], Status[1] or Status[2] i.e. OK, START OR ACTION
Valid options: 1, 2, 3 and 4

-When count is 2
Trick can be 0 or 1
Turn+Trick can be 5 or 6
Status[Trick] can be OK or START
Valid options: 1, 3 and 4

-When count is 1
Trick will be 0
Turn+Trick will be 5
Status[Trick] can be OK only

Hmm.., but there seems no option matching with the predicted output. I believe there should be a OK either in the 3rd or 4th option (1st one has been eliminated because of having 7).
