- foreach loop iterates through elements but for performing deletion using RemoveAt(), index must be known.

- for loop can be used with RemoveAt() for such purpose. Here's the pseudo code/algo:

 IF CHOICE == 'DELETE' 
   x = What to delete
   for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++){
    if( x == list[i]){
       list.RemoveAt[i];
    }
   }
 
 - Index can also be obtained using IndexOf method, but it returns the first index of an item if found in the list.
