public static int (int X, int Y) {
No function name is mentioned.

while (size<=Y) 
It should not check for equality here. Refer the question:

Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
size * 2;
This surely is doing size*2 but isn't updating any value.

See the required changes below:
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
public static int fun (int N) {
  int size=1000;
  int hours = 0;
  while (size<N) {
    hours+=12;
    size*=2;
  }
  return hours;
}
