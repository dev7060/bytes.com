I am not sure in case of Python, but in general, all major operating systems will free the memory upon the termination of process.

Are you referring to the memory that is being dynamically allocated? In C/C++, we use free() function to release the dynamically allocated space (since it doesn't get freed on its own).

Hope that helps
