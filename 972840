Several things:

- You need to write the desired code in the function's body.

//functions' declarations
main(){
...
}
//functions' definitions
fun1(){
...
}
fun2(){
...
}
 
 
- Function has to be called from main.
- Since the function is returning char data type, it can either be stored in a variable or can be shown directly to the console.

char newCh=leeskl();
 
or

printf("%c", leeskl());

- Other than that, the logic for uppercase to lowercase looks fine.
