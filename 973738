I'd suggest working with the CLI first. There's not much in working on the upper level without knowing how and what stuff actually works behind the scenes. It may also depend on the individual itself.

I wouldn't recommend Windows XP. Using Windows XP comes with its downsides too. First, its support has been ended (hence no security updates, you're compromising with the security here then). Second, it may not guarantee the compatibility with the latest releases of the IDE and hence missing features. Third, switching to an old interface just because of the privacy concerns for the sake of learning doesn't seem a justified reason to me. It would make sense if one starts writing professional-quality code since the beginning. If privacy is the concern, Linux distros are the best.

On a side note, I genuinely don't believe that Microsoft can compromise with privacy by recording the keystrokes. Windows is the most popular operating system used in the world. They may record the stuff entered while the user searches something through the start menu or while using services like Cortana for the betterment of their products but in a text editor or IDE? that's quite hard to believe. In fact, Microsoft offers a free editor called vscode that's a lot popular among devs. I may believe so if they offer customized versions of Windows and servers to FBI, CIA or NSA and provide different to others.
