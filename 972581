What errors are you getting exactly? What case of insertion are you implementing? Insertion at end? beginning? or at a particular location?

For insertion at the end, a pointer variable (say ptr) should be made to point to the last node (done with the help of loop). Then, ptr-> next = node , where node->data is provided by the user and node->next is NULL.
