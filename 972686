Library function cos() requires double type actual parameter to work on. For the statement, cos(n + func(n - 1)), n is of float type but the function calling part is not returning any value because of function, having the return type 'void'. Therefore, cos(float + void) doesn't make any sense for the binary operator '+'. Change the return type of the function to make the whole expression producing a uniform data type result.
